Instead of using a 2-dimensional array which is\ncomplicated and inflexible, I changed the storage of tasks from array\n(String) to class (Task). Task contains a description of the task\n(description) and a boolean to track whether a task is completed\n(isDone). Primarily, this commit implements the mark as done command\nand changed the tasks from string to an object.\n\nThis commit should make future implementation of other functions easier.\n","tags":["A-CodingStandard"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":64,"deletions":21}}}]},{"date":"2021-01-26","commitResults":[{"hash":"87e6483083583cfa4cf1f4e82ee350e539a4b9c0","messageTitle":"Update code syntax to follow standard","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":33,"deletions":13}}}]},{"date":"2021-02-01","commitResults":[{"hash":"b0092f6dc18952ba468a0768924c4a1eebeb5845","messageTitle":"Add task classification, completion date and refractor code","messageBody":"Because,\n* the old structure is very difficult to read and interpret.\n* the classification of task is difficult to implement with the current\napproach since each category has some common and some unique features.\n* there is flexibility for future additions of other functions and\nparameters associated with the task (object).\n\nLet\u0027s add a few features in this update. Firstly, tasks are now\nclassified into 3 different categories - todo, deadline and event.\n\nTodo, Deadline and Event classes have some common behaviors (e.g.\ndescription, isDone). The common behaviors across these classes cause\ncode duplication.\n\nExtracting the common behavior into a super class allows us to use\npolymorphism when managing a task. For example, the checking of task\nstatus can be done for all categories of tasks in one loop.\n\nLet\u0027s pull up behaviors common to all task attribute classes into the\nparent class called Task and keep the unique attributes in each child\nclass.\n\nInheritance is used in this situation because it is simple to code and\nunderstand. This method is also flexible to new features.\n\nSecondly, the code is refactored to make us understand and interpret\nthe code easier.\n\nMagic numbers are extracted to global constants to explain the use of\neach number better. The readability is also enhanced with the\nstructural change. Some error handling is also implemented to enhance\nusability and reliability, and makes the application more responsive.\n","tags":["Level-4"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":381,"deletions":67}}}]},{"date":"2021-02-02","commitResults":[{"hash":"74c18acb5ca7b6e390628002a1a81c0394c7f590","messageTitle":"Add automated text UI testing","messageBody":"","tags":["A-TextUiTesting"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":11,"deletions":0},"bat":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2}}},{"hash":"17b31a955b3c162d0d2794cf9599f500208b3916","messageTitle":"Update code syntax to follow standard","messageBody":"","tags":["A-CodeQuality"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":35,"deletions":20}}}]},{"date":"2021-02-03","commitResults":[{"hash":"8b3d0c53580961d18356045fb2647f70f63911e1","messageTitle":"Update code syntax based on feedback","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":18,"deletions":24}}}]},{"date":"2021-02-07","commitResults":[{"hash":"6ca61ce176ee445a2043aa8c0e57ca8d6fcf78d7","messageTitle":"Add error and exception handling","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Exceptions"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":104,"deletions":62}}},{"hash":"c6ee84248d1f63c47a1e8528e2c97e8c4e85c209","messageTitle":"Update code syntax to follow standard","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":93,"deletions":51}}},{"hash":"34643613ab5f27754118b3dfd1a1c8e14053947b","messageTitle":"Remove IllegalArgumentException file and fix task number bug","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2}}},{"hash":"0d4616c6a8074571e151d8e84a85dcd795d209e1","messageTitle":"Move classes into packages","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":18,"deletions":2}}}]},{"date":"2021-02-09","commitResults":[{"hash":"273d6379330ffa072ec5b437e7b57dd930f94743","messageTitle":"Update automated text UI testing","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Packages"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"bat":{"insertions":4,"deletions":3}}}]},{"date":"2021-02-14","commitResults":[{"hash":"f9ceeb0aacfd224cc0ede5a11d7594b4aba8a897","messageTitle":"Implement delete task function and change array to list","messageBody":"Because,\n* the total number of tasks in the task list is varied\n* deletion is difficult for the array abstract data type\n* the original array data type would reserve space for tasks that may\nnot exist, wasting memory space.\n* there is flexibility for future implmentations of modifying and\nrelocating of tasks from within the list.\n","tags":["A-Collections"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":79,"deletions":50}}}]},{"date":"2021-02-15","commitResults":[{"hash":"0f4fa0a70fa8c972238ec391d51e366cf84895a4","messageTitle":"Add output task list to file","messageBody":"Because:\n* the task list is only useful if it is persistent between uses.\n* it allows the user to close the program between uses to save\nresources.\n* there is a reference if even if the program is not launched.\n\nThe format of the stored tasks are comma seperated.
